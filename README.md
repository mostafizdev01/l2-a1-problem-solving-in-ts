<h3>1. What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?</h3>
<p>The Interface can be extended and merged, mainly for defining object shapes and class contracts. and 
Type is more flexible, can represent unions, primitives, and intersections, but canâ€™t be reopened or merged.
Use interface for defining objects and classes, type for complex types or unions
</p>

<h3>2. What is type inference in TypeScript? Why is it helpful?</h3>
<p>Type inference in TypeScript is when the compiler automatically figures out the type of a variable or expression without you explicitly declaring itd.
and it's Saves you from writing types all the time. Helps catch type errors early.
Makes code cleaner and easier to read while still being type-safe
